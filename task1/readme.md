This project contains task 1 of Quantum internship test assignment.
Within the solution a synthetic dataset has been created for training a NER model for mountain names. BERT model have been finetuned on this dataset and inferenced on samples of text.

dataset.ipynb - describes dataset prepation
training.py - script for finetuning a BERT model
inference.py - script for inference of finetuned model
demo.ipynb - usage of the finetuned model on samples
requirements.txt - libraries needed to run the project
